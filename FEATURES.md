# Project Features

This document outlines the key features of the MCP-Web-UI-Client project.

## Core Functionality

*   **Strategy Creation:** Utilizes Groq AI to develop comprehensive viral content strategies.
*   **Content Generation:** Employs AI models like Claude and Gemini to generate engaging scripts and text-based content.
*   **Media Production:**
    *   **Video:** Integrates with RunwayML for automated video generation.
    *   **Audio:** Uses ElevenLabs for realistic voiceovers and audio production.
    *   **Images:** Leverages Stable Diffusion for creating custom images.
*   **Content Assembly:** Uses Canva to combine various media elements (video, audio, images, text) into a cohesive final product.
*   **Cloud Storage:** Archives all generated content and media assets on Google Drive for easy access and backup.
*   **Multi-Platform Distribution:** Enables automated posting and scheduling of content across various social media platforms, including:
    *   YouTube
    *   TikTok
    *   Instagram
*   **Analytics & Optimization:** Implements an analytics feedback loop to track content performance and optimize future strategies for maximum engagement and reach.

## Supporting Systems

*   **Auto-Healing System:** Includes robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure system stability and resilience. If an automated action fails (e.g., a UI element is not found), the system attempts to recover and continue the process.
*   **Viral Psychology Engine:** Incorporates principles of viral marketing and psychology to generate content elements (e.g., hooks, emotional triggers) designed to maximize engagement and shareability.
*   **Content Review System:** Features a content safety check to flag potentially problematic content. If necessary, content is sent for human review before distribution to ensure compliance with platform guidelines and ethical considerations.

## Extensibility

*   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new services (e.g., new social media platforms, new AI content tools).
*   **Environment Variable Configuration:** Credentials and service-specific settings are managed through environment variables for security and ease of deployment.

## Deployment

*   **Render Backend Deployment (Recommended):** The project is optimized for deployment on Render.
    *   **Fully Managed Service:** Render handles infrastructure management, reducing operational overhead.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** Offers persistent storage solutions for application data and assets.
    *   **Easy Scaling:** Allows for straightforward scaling of resources to meet demand.
    *   **Free Tier Available:** Provides a free tier, making it cost-effective for initial setup and smaller projects.
    *   **Architecture:** Typically involves a Node.js backend on Render, potentially with a static React frontend, and utilizes Google Drive and MongoDB for storage.
